How may I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi Mark, yeah uh I'm calling about a flight I have scheduled next week. The flight number is UA1542 from Chicago to San Francisco.\\n\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull that flight up. *typing noises* Alright, I've got the flight details here. What seems to be the issue you're calling about?\\n\\nCustomer: Well uh, I'm actually gonna have to cancel that flight. Something came up and I won't be able to make the trip after all. So I was hoping to get a refund or maybe change it to a different date.\\n\\nAgent: I understand, things come up. Let me take a look at the refund policy for that route. *more typing* Unfortunately because it's within a week of departure, the ticket is non-refundable. However, we can change the dates for you for a $150 change fee, as long as the new travel is within the next year. Would you like me to go ahead and change the dates for you?\\n\\nCustomer: Umm yeah let me think for a second. *pause* What if I changed it to like next month instead of within a year? Would the fee still be $150 then?\\n\\nAgent: Let me double check the fee for changing it to next month specifically. *typing* It looks like the fee would actually be waived if you changed it to within the next 30 days. So if there's a flight next month that works better for you, I can go ahead and change it at no additional cost. Do you have any dates in mind?\\n\\nCustomer: Okay great, thanks. Let me pull up my calendar real quick... *longer pause with typing/rustling noises* Yeah is there anything available for like the first or second week of November? I'd like to go out there for a work thing if possible. \\n\\nAgent: No problem, take your time looking. *also quietly types for a bit* Alright, for the first week of November I'm seeing availability on November 3rd, leaving Chicago at 11am and getting into San Francisco at 1pm. How does that date work for you?\\n\\nCustomer: Hmm that date could work, let me double check with my coworkers real quick to make sure the timing will line up with our meetings out there... *phone rustling, muffled voices* Yeah that November 3rd flight looks good to me, I'll go ahead and change it to that.\\n\\nAgent: Great, I've gone ahead and processed the change for you. You should see the updated itinerary in your United account within the next 24 hours. Thanks for being so flexible on the dates - I'm happy we could get you rescheduled without any change fees. Please let me know if any other issues come up before your new travel date.\\n\\nCustomer: Okay awesome, thank you so much for your help Mark I really appreciate you changing that for me. Have a good rest of your day!\\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome, glad I could assist. Enjoy your trip to San Francisco! You have a good day as well.\\n\\nCustomer: Thanks, you too! Goodbye.\\n\\nAgent: Goodbye!\\n\\n*call disconnects*\",\n          \"\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines, my name is Sarah, how may I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi Sarah, umm I'm calling about a flight I had booked from Chicago to Boston last week. It got delayed by a couple hours and I missed my connecting flight.\\n\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear about that delay, what are the dates of your travels so I can take a look at your reservation? \\n\\nCustomer: It was last Thursday, May 12th. Flight number was UA1402, it was supposed to leave Chicago at 2pm but ended up leaving around 4pm.\\n\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull up your reservation. *typing sounds* Yep, I see here your flight from Chicago to Boston was delayed due to bad weather in Chicago that day. The flight ended up departing at 4:17pm instead of the scheduled 2pm time. I understand that must have caused you to miss your connecting flight to your final destination. One moment while I take a look at our policies in this situation. *longer pause as agent reviews policies* So based on the delay being due to weather, which is considered a controllable delay by United, you would be eligible for a one-time goodwill gesture from us due to the missed connection. I can offer to refund your ticket for that flight, or apply the amount as a travel credit to use for a future booking. Which option would you prefer?\\n\\nCustomer: Hmm that's really nice of you guys to offer one of those options as a goodwill gesture. I think I'll go with the travel credit if that's ok, I'm sure to fly United again at some point in the next year. It'll be nice to have that credit available. \\n\\nAgent: Absolutely, I've gone ahead and processed a full travel credit for the value of your May 12th ticket. The credit will be valid for one year from today and can be used for future United flights. The reference number for that is CR348921. Please keep that on hand in case you need it when booking your next trip. I'm glad we could resolve this situation to your satisfaction. Thank you for understanding about the weather delay causing your missed connection. Is there anything else I can help with today?\\n\\nCustomer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks so much for your help, Sarah. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this and provide that travel credit. It will definitely be used.\\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome, have a great rest of your day!\\n\\nCustomer: You too, thanks again and bye!\\n\\nAgent: Goodbye!\",\n          \"\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines, this is Steve how can I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi Steve, yeah I'm calling because I have a flight booked from Chicago to New York next week and I was hoping to change it. *sigh* This work thing has come up last minute and I need to fly out a day earlier.\\n\\nAgent: I understand, last minute changes can be frustrating. Let me take a look at your booking and see what I can do for you. What's the name the reservation is under?\\n\\nCustomer: It's under John Smith. The original flight was supposed to leave next Thursday.\\n\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull that up... *typing sounds* Alright, I've got your reservation here Mr. Smith. It looks like the flight you booked is pretty full for the day before. Let me check some alternate flight options... *more typing* Hmm, the only option I see is a late afternoon flight that leaves at 4pm, would that work for your schedule?\\n\\nCustomer: Ugh yeah I think that could work, but is it going to cost me a lot more to change it last minute like this? Money is a bit tight with everything going on.\\n\\nAgent: I understand the financial concerns. Unfortunately because it is within 7 days of travel, there would be a change fee applied. The good news is because this flight is still fairly full, the fare difference is only an additional $100 on top of the standard $200 change fee. So your new total would be $300 to switch to that earlier flight. Does that work for your budget?\\n\\nCustomer: *sighs* Yeah I guess $300 is better than having to reschedule the whole work thing. Alright, go ahead and change it for me then.\\n\\nAgent: No problem, I'm happy I could find an option that works. Let me go ahead and process that change for you... *typing sounds* Okay, all set! You're now booked on the 4pm flight next Wednesday. You'll receive an email confirmation shortly. Do you need anything else from me today?\\n\\nCustomer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks so much for your help, Steve. I really appreciate you finding a solution on short notice.\\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome, Mr. Smith. Happy I could assist with the change. Safe travels and enjoy your trip to New York.

How may I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi Mark, yeah uh I'm calling about a flight I have scheduled next week. The flight number is UA1542 from Chicago to San Francisco.\\n\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull that flight up. *typing noises* Alright, I've got the flight details here. What seems to be the issue you're calling about?\\n\\nCustomer: Well uh, I'm actually gonna have to cancel that flight. Something came up and I won't be able to make the trip after all. So I was hoping to get a refund or maybe change it to a different date.\\n\\nAgent: I understand, things come up. Let me take a look at the refund policy for that route. *more typing* Unfortunately because it's within a week of departure, the ticket is non-refundable. However, we can change the dates for you for a $150 change fee, as long as the new travel is within the next year. Would you like me to go ahead and change the dates for you?\\n\\nCustomer: Umm yeah let me think for a second. *pause* What if I changed it to like next month instead of within a year? Would the fee still be $150 then?\\n\\nAgent: Let me double check the fee for changing it to next month specifically. *typing* It looks like the fee would actually be waived if you changed it to within the next 30 days. So if there's a flight next month that works better for you, I can go ahead and change it at no additional cost. Do you have any dates in mind?\\n\\nCustomer: Okay great, thanks. Let me pull up my calendar real quick... *longer pause with typing/rustling noises* Yeah is there anything available for like the first or second week of November? I'd like to go out there for a work thing if possible. \\n\\nAgent: No problem, take your time looking. *also quietly types for a bit* Alright, for the first week of November I'm seeing availability on November 3rd, leaving Chicago at 11am and getting into San Francisco at 1pm. How does that date work for you?\\n\\nCustomer: Hmm that date could work, let me double check with my coworkers real quick to make sure the timing will line up with our meetings out there... *phone rustling, muffled voices* Yeah that November 3rd flight looks good to me, I'll go ahead and change it to that.\\n\\nAgent: Great, I've gone ahead and processed the change for you. You should see the updated itinerary in your United account within the next 24 hours. Thanks for being so flexible on the dates - I'm happy we could get you rescheduled without any change fees. Please let me know if any other issues come up before your new travel date.\\n\\nCustomer: Okay awesome, thank you so much for your help Mark I really appreciate you changing that for me. Have a good rest of your day!\\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome, glad I could assist. Enjoy your trip to San Francisco! You have a good day as well.\\n\\nCustomer: Thanks, you too! Goodbye.\\n\\nAgent: Goodbye!\\n\\n*call disconnects*\",\n          \"\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines, my name is Sarah, how may I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi Sarah, umm I'm calling about a flight I had booked from Chicago to Boston last week. It got delayed by a couple hours and I missed my connecting flight.\\n\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear about that delay, what are the dates of your travels so I can take a look at your reservation? \\n\\nCustomer: It was last Thursday, May 12th. Flight number was UA1402, it was supposed to leave Chicago at 2pm but ended up leaving around 4pm.\\n\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull up your reservation. *typing sounds* Yep, I see here your flight from Chicago to Boston was delayed due to bad weather in Chicago that day. The flight ended up departing at 4:17pm instead of the scheduled 2pm time. I understand that must have caused you to miss your connecting flight to your final destination. One moment while I take a look at our policies in this situation. *longer pause as agent reviews policies* So based on the delay being due to weather, which is considered a controllable delay by United, you would be eligible for a one-time goodwill gesture from us due to the missed connection. I can offer to refund your ticket for that flight, or apply the amount as a travel credit to use for a future booking. Which option would you prefer?\\n\\nCustomer: Hmm that's really nice of you guys to offer one of those options as a goodwill gesture. I think I'll go with the travel credit if that's ok, I'm sure to fly United again at some point in the next year. It'll be nice to have that credit available. \\n\\nAgent: Absolutely, I've gone ahead and processed a full travel credit for the value of your May 12th ticket. The credit will be valid for one year from today and can be used for future United flights. The reference number for that is CR348921. Please keep that on hand in case you need it when booking your next trip. I'm glad we could resolve this situation to your satisfaction. Thank you for understanding about the weather delay causing your missed connection. Is there anything else I can help with today?\\n\\nCustomer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks so much for your help, Sarah. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this and provide that travel credit. It will definitely be used.\\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome, have a great rest of your day!\\n\\nCustomer: You too, thanks again and bye!\\n\\nAgent: Goodbye!\",\n          \"\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines, this is Steve how can I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi Steve, yeah I'm calling because I have a flight booked from Chicago to New York next week and I was hoping to change it. *sigh* This work thing has come up last minute and I need to fly out a day earlier.\\n\\nAgent: I understand, last minute changes can be frustrating. Let me take a look at your booking and see what I can do for you. What's the name the reservation is under?\\n\\nCustomer: It's under John Smith. The original flight was supposed to leave next Thursday.\\n\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull that up... *typing sounds* Alright, I've got your reservation here Mr. Smith. It looks like the flight you booked is pretty full for the day before. Let me check some alternate flight options... *more typing* Hmm, the only option I see is a late afternoon flight that leaves at 4pm, would that work for your schedule?\\n\\nCustomer: Ugh yeah I think that could work, but is it going to cost me a lot more to change it last minute like this? Money is a bit tight with everything going on.\\n\\nAgent: I understand the financial concerns. Unfortunately because it is within 7 days of travel, there would be a change fee applied. The good news is because this flight is still fairly full, the fare difference is only an additional $100 on top of the standard $200 change fee. So your new total would be $300 to switch to that earlier flight. Does that work for your budget?\\n\\nCustomer: *sighs* Yeah I guess $300 is better than having to reschedule the whole work thing. Alright, go ahead and change it for me then.\\n\\nAgent: No problem, I'm happy I could find an option that works. Let me go ahead and process that change for you... *typing sounds* Okay, all set! You're now booked on the 4pm flight next Wednesday. You'll receive an email confirmation shortly. Do you need anything else from me today?\\n\\nCustomer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks so much for your help, Steve. I really appreciate you finding a solution on short notice.\\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome, Mr. Smith. Happy I could assist with the change. Safe travels and enjoy your trip to New York. Have a great rest of your day!\\n\\nCustomer: You too, thanks again! *call disconnects*\\n\\nAgent: *sigh of relief* Next! *keyboard typing, phone ringing in background* Thank you for calling United Airlines, this is Steve how can I help you today?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ST\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"timedelta64[ns]\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 13,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"0 days 00:15:00\",\n          \"0 days 00:06:00\",\n          \"0 days 00:07:00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"HT\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"timedelta64[ns]\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 119,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"0 days 00:53:00\",\n          \"0 days 00:49:00\",\n          \"0 days 00:09:00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"primary_call_reason\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 54,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" Baggage\",\n          \"Traveler Updates  \",\n          \"Products and Services  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"agent_id_y\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 257532,\n        \"min\": 102574,\n        \"max\": 993862,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 383,\n        \"samples\": [\n          461615,\n          524342,\n          901733\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"agent_tone\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"calm\",\n          \"polite\",\n          \"frustrated\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"customer_tone\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"neutral\",\n          \"calm\",\n          \"polite\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"average_sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.14371548011149202,\n        \"min\": -1.38,\n        \"max\": 2.67,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 183,\n        \"samples\": [\n          -0.18,\n          -0.15,\n          -0.79\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"silence_percent_average\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.19203137555060695,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.98,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 99,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.68,\n          0.06,\n          0.98\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"customer_name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 54514,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jennifer Cantu\",\n          \"Rachael Charles\",\n          \"Erika Gregory\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"elite_level_code\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.3222968825150845,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 5.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4.0,\n          2.0,\n          3.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

How may I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi Mark, yeah uh I'm calling about a flight I have scheduled next week. The flight number is UA1542 from Chicago to San Francisco.\\n\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull that flight up. *typing noises* Alright, I've got the flight details here. What seems to be the issue you're calling about?\\n\\nCustomer: Well uh, I'm actually gonna have to cancel that flight. Something came up and I won't be able to make the trip after all. So I was hoping to get a refund or maybe change it to a different date.\\n\\nAgent: I understand, things come up. Let me take a look at the refund policy for that route. *more typing* Unfortunately because it's within a week of departure, the ticket is non-refundable. However, we can change the dates for you for a $150 change fee, as long as the new travel is within the next year. Would you like me to go ahead and change the dates for you?\\n\\nCustomer: Umm yeah let me think for a second. *pause* What if I changed it to like next month instead of within a year? Would the fee still be $150 then?\\n\\nAgent: Let me double check the fee for changing it to next month specifically. *typing* It looks like the fee would actually be waived if you changed it to within the next 30 days. So if there's a flight next month that works better for you, I can go ahead and change it at no additional cost. Do you have any dates in mind?\\n\\nCustomer: Okay great, thanks. Let me pull up my calendar real quick... *longer pause with typing/rustling noises* Yeah is there anything available for like the first or second week of November? I'd like to go out there for a work thing if possible. \\n\\nAgent: No problem, take your time looking. *also quietly types for a bit* Alright, for the first week of November I'm seeing availability on November 3rd, leaving Chicago at 11am and getting into San Francisco at 1pm. How does that date work for you?\\n\\nCustomer: Hmm that date could work, let me double check with my coworkers real quick to make sure the timing will line up with our meetings out there... *phone rustling, muffled voices* Yeah that November 3rd flight looks good to me, I'll go ahead and change it to that.\\n\\nAgent: Great, I've gone ahead and processed the change for you. You should see the updated itinerary in your United account within the next 24 hours. Thanks for being so flexible on the dates - I'm happy we could get you rescheduled without any change fees. Please let me know if any other issues come up before your new travel date.\\n\\nCustomer: Okay awesome, thank you so much for your help Mark I really appreciate you changing that for me. Have a good rest of your day!\\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome, glad I could assist. Enjoy your trip to San Francisco! You have a good day as well.\\n\\nCustomer: Thanks, you too! Goodbye.\\n\\nAgent: Goodbye!\\n\\n*call disconnects*\",\n          \"\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines, my name is Sarah, how may I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi Sarah, umm I'm calling about a flight I had booked from Chicago to Boston last week. It got delayed by a couple hours and I missed my connecting flight.\\n\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear about that delay, what are the dates of your travels so I can take a look at your reservation? \\n\\nCustomer: It was last Thursday, May 12th. Flight number was UA1402, it was supposed to leave Chicago at 2pm but ended up leaving around 4pm.\\n\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull up your reservation. *typing sounds* Yep, I see here your flight from Chicago to Boston was delayed due to bad weather in Chicago that day. The flight ended up departing at 4:17pm instead of the scheduled 2pm time. I understand that must have caused you to miss your connecting flight to your final destination. One moment while I take a look at our policies in this situation. *longer pause as agent reviews policies* So based on the delay being due to weather, which is considered a controllable delay by United, you would be eligible for a one-time goodwill gesture from us due to the missed connection. I can offer to refund your ticket for that flight, or apply the amount as a travel credit to use for a future booking. Which option would you prefer?\\n\\nCustomer: Hmm that's really nice of you guys to offer one of those options as a goodwill gesture. I think I'll go with the travel credit if that's ok, I'm sure to fly United again at some point in the next year. It'll be nice to have that credit available. \\n\\nAgent: Absolutely, I've gone ahead and processed a full travel credit for the value of your May 12th ticket. The credit will be valid for one year from today and can be used for future United flights. The reference number for that is CR348921. Please keep that on hand in case you need it when booking your next trip. I'm glad we could resolve this situation to your satisfaction. Thank you for understanding about the weather delay causing your missed connection. Is there anything else I can help with today?\\n\\nCustomer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks so much for your help, Sarah. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this and provide that travel credit. It will definitely be used.\\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome, have a great rest of your day!\\n\\nCustomer: You too, thanks again and bye!\\n\\nAgent: Goodbye!\",\n          \"\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines, this is Steve how can I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi Steve, yeah I'm calling because I have a flight booked from Chicago to New York next week and I was hoping to change it. *sigh* This work thing has come up last minute and I need to fly out a day earlier.\\n\\nAgent: I understand, last minute changes can be frustrating. Let me take a look at your booking and see what I can do for you. What's the name the reservation is under?\\n\\nCustomer: It's under John Smith. The original flight was supposed to leave next Thursday.\\n\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull that up... *typing sounds* Alright, I've got your reservation here Mr. Smith. It looks like the flight you booked is pretty full for the day before. Let me check some alternate flight options... *more typing* Hmm, the only option I see is a late afternoon flight that leaves at 4pm, would that work for your schedule?\\n\\nCustomer: Ugh yeah I think that could work, but is it going to cost me a lot more to change it last minute like this? Money is a bit tight with everything going on.\\n\\nAgent: I understand the financial concerns. Unfortunately because it is within 7 days of travel, there would be a change fee applied. The good news is because this flight is still fairly full, the fare difference is only an additional $100 on top of the standard $200 change fee. So your new total would be $300 to switch to that earlier flight. Does that work for your budget?\\n\\nCustomer: *sighs* Yeah I guess $300 is better than having to reschedule the whole work thing. Alright, go ahead and change it for me then.\\n\\nAgent: No problem, I'm happy I could find an option that works. Let me go ahead and process that change for you... *typing sounds* Okay, all set! You're now booked on the 4pm flight next Wednesday. You'll receive an email confirmation shortly. Do you need anything else from me today?\\n\\nCustomer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks so much for your help, Steve. I really appreciate you finding a solution on short notice.\\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome, Mr. Smith. Happy I could assist with the change. Safe travels and enjoy your trip to New York. Have a great rest of your day!\\n\\nCustomer: You too, thanks again! *call disconnects*\\n\\nAgent: *sigh of relief* Next! *keyboard typing, phone ringing in background* Thank you for calling United Airlines, this is Steve how can I help you today?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ST\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"timedelta64[ns]\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 13,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"0 days 00:15:00\",\n          \"0 days 00:06:00\",\n          \"0 days 00:07:00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"HT\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"timedelta64[ns]\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 119,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"0 days 00:53:00\",\n          \"0 days 00:49:00\",\n          \"0 days 00:09:00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"agent_tone\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.5844861226987775,\n        \"min\": -2.0,\n        \"max\": 2.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          2.0,\n          -1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"customer_tone\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": -2,\n        \"max\": 2,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1,\n          2\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"average_sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.14371548011149202,\n        \"min\": -1.38,\n        \"max\": 2.67,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 183,\n        \"samples\": [\n          -0.18,\n          -0.15,\n          -0.79\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"silence_percent_average\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.19203137555060695,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.98,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 99,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.68,\n          0.06,\n          0.98\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"elite_level_code\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.3222968825150845,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 5.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          4.0,\n          2.0,\n          3.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"HT_seconds\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 774.301509250498,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 7140.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 119,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3180.0,\n          2940.0,\n          540.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ST_seconds\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 151.12977141285202,\n        \"min\": 180.0,\n        \"max\": 900.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 13,\n        \"samples\": [\n          900.0,\n          360.0,\n          420.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

How may I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi Mark, yeah uh I'm calling about a flight I have scheduled next week. The flight number is UA1542 from Chicago to San Francisco.\\n\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull that flight up. *typing noises* Alright, I've got the flight details here. What seems to be the issue you're calling about?\\n\\nCustomer: Well uh, I'm actually gonna have to cancel that flight. Something came up and I won't be able to make the trip after all. So I was hoping to get a refund or maybe change it to a different date.\\n\\nAgent: I understand, things come up. Let me take a look at the refund policy for that route. *more typing* Unfortunately because it's within a week of departure, the ticket is non-refundable. However, we can change the dates for you for a $150 change fee, as long as the new travel is within the next year. Would you like me to go ahead and change the dates for you?\\n\\nCustomer: Umm yeah let me think for a second. *pause* What if I changed it to like next month instead of within a year? Would the fee still be $150 then?\\n\\nAgent: Let me double check the fee for changing it to next month specifically. *typing* It looks like the fee would actually be waived if you changed it to within the next 30 days. So if there's a flight next month that works better for you, I can go ahead and change it at no additional cost. Do you have any dates in mind?\\n\\nCustomer: Okay great, thanks. Let me pull up my calendar real quick... *longer pause with typing/rustling noises* Yeah is there anything available for like the first or second week of November? I'd like to go out there for a work thing if possible. \\n\\nAgent: No problem, take your time looking. *also quietly types for a bit* Alright, for the first week of November I'm seeing availability on November 3rd, leaving Chicago at 11am and getting into San Francisco at 1pm. How does that date work for you?\\n\\nCustomer: Hmm that date could work, let me double check with my coworkers real quick to make sure the timing will line up with our meetings out there... *phone rustling, muffled voices* Yeah that November 3rd flight looks good to me, I'll go ahead and change it to that.\\n\\nAgent: Great, I've gone ahead and processed the change for you. You should see the updated itinerary in your United account within the next 24 hours. Thanks for being so flexible on the dates - I'm happy we could get you rescheduled without any change fees. Please let me know if any other issues come up before your new travel date.\\n\\nCustomer: Okay awesome, thank you so much for your help Mark I really appreciate you changing that for me. Have a good rest of your day!\\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome, glad I could assist. Enjoy your trip to San Francisco! You have a good day as well.\\n\\nCustomer: Thanks, you too! Goodbye.\\n\\nAgent: Goodbye!\\n\\n*call disconnects*\",\n          \"\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines, my name is Sarah, how may I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi Sarah, umm I'm calling about a flight I had booked from Chicago to Boston last week. It got delayed by a couple hours and I missed my connecting flight.\\n\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear about that delay, what are the dates of your travels so I can take a look at your reservation? \\n\\nCustomer: It was last Thursday, May 12th. Flight number was UA1402, it was supposed to leave Chicago at 2pm but ended up leaving around 4pm.\\n\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull up your reservation. *typing sounds* Yep, I see here your flight from Chicago to Boston was delayed due to bad weather in Chicago that day. The flight ended up departing at 4:17pm instead of the scheduled 2pm time. I understand that must have caused you to miss your connecting flight to your final destination. One moment while I take a look at our policies in this situation. *longer pause as agent reviews policies* So based on the delay being due to weather, which is considered a controllable delay by United, you would be eligible for a one-time goodwill gesture from us due to the missed connection. I can offer to refund your ticket for that flight, or apply the amount as a travel credit to use for a future booking. Which option would you prefer?\\n\\nCustomer: Hmm that's really nice of you guys to offer one of those options as a goodwill gesture. I think I'll go with the travel credit if that's ok, I'm sure to fly United again at some point in the next year. It'll be nice to have that credit available. \\n\\nAgent: Absolutely, I've gone ahead and processed a full travel credit for the value of your May 12th ticket. The credit will be valid for one year from today and can be used for future United flights. The reference number for that is CR348921. Please keep that on hand in case you need it when booking your next trip. I'm glad we could resolve this situation to your satisfaction. Thank you for understanding about the weather delay causing your missed connection. Is there anything else I can help with today?\\n\\nCustomer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks so much for your help, Sarah. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this and provide that travel credit. It will definitely be used.\\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome, have a great rest of your day!\\n\\nCustomer: You too, thanks again and bye!\\n\\nAgent: Goodbye!\",\n          \"\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines, this is Steve how can I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi Steve, yeah I'm calling because I have a flight booked from Chicago to New York next week and I was hoping to change it. *sigh* This work thing has come up last minute and I need to fly out a day earlier.\\n\\nAgent: I understand, last minute changes can be frustrating. Let me take a look at your booking and see what I can do for you. What's the name the reservation is under?\\n\\nCustomer: It's under John Smith. The original flight was supposed to leave next Thursday.\\n\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull that up... *typing sounds* Alright, I've got your reservation here Mr. Smith. It looks like the flight you booked is pretty full for the day before. Let me check some alternate flight options... *more typing* Hmm, the only option I see is a late afternoon flight that leaves at 4pm, would that work for your schedule?\\n\\nCustomer: Ugh yeah I think that could work, but is it going to cost me a lot more to change it last minute like this? Money is a bit tight with everything going on.\\n\\nAgent: I understand the financial concerns. Unfortunately because it is within 7 days of travel, there would be a change fee applied. The good news is because this flight is still fairly full, the fare difference is only an additional $100 on top of the standard $200 change fee. So your new total would be $300 to switch to that earlier flight. Does that work for your budget?\\n\\nCustomer: *sighs* Yeah I guess $300 is better than having to reschedule the whole work thing. Alright, go ahead and change it for me then.\\n\\nAgent: No problem, I'm happy I could find an option that works. Let me go ahead and process that change for you... *typing sounds* Okay, all set! You're now booked on the 4pm flight next Wednesday. You'll receive an email confirmation shortly. Do you need anything else from me today?\\n\\nCustomer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks so much for your help, Steve. I really appreciate you finding a solution on short notice.\\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome, Mr. Smith. Happy I could assist with the change. Safe travels and enjoy your trip to New York.

How may I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi Mark, yeah uh I'm calling about a flight I have scheduled next week. The flight number is UA1542 from Chicago to San Francisco.\\n\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull that flight up. *typing noises* Alright, I've got the flight details here. What seems to be the issue you're calling about?\\n\\nCustomer: Well uh, I'm actually gonna have to cancel that flight. Something came up and I won't be able to make the trip after all. So I was hoping to get a refund or maybe change it to a different date.\\n\\nAgent: I understand, things come up. Let me take a look at the refund policy for that route. *more typing* Unfortunately because it's within a week of departure, the ticket is non-refundable. However, we can change the dates for you for a $150 change fee, as long as the new travel is within the next year. Would you like me to go ahead and change the dates for you?\\n\\nCustomer: Umm yeah let me think for a second. *pause* What if I changed it to like next month instead of within a year? Would the fee still be $150 then?\\n\\nAgent: Let me double check the fee for changing it to next month specifically. *typing* It looks like the fee would actually be waived if you changed it to within the next 30 days. So if there's a flight next month that works better for you, I can go ahead and change it at no additional cost. Do you have any dates in mind?\\n\\nCustomer: Okay great, thanks. Let me pull up my calendar real quick... *longer pause with typing/rustling noises* Yeah is there anything available for like the first or second week of November? I'd like to go out there for a work thing if possible. \\n\\nAgent: No problem, take your time looking. *also quietly types for a bit* Alright, for the first week of November I'm seeing availability on November 3rd, leaving Chicago at 11am and getting into San Francisco at 1pm. How does that date work for you?\\n\\nCustomer: Hmm that date could work, let me double check with my coworkers real quick to make sure the timing will line up with our meetings out there... *phone rustling, muffled voices* Yeah that November 3rd flight looks good to me, I'll go ahead and change it to that.\\n\\nAgent: Great, I've gone ahead and processed the change for you. You should see the updated itinerary in your United account within the next 24 hours. Thanks for being so flexible on the dates - I'm happy we could get you rescheduled without any change fees. Please let me know if any other issues come up before your new travel date.\\n\\nCustomer: Okay awesome, thank you so much for your help Mark I really appreciate you changing that for me. Have a good rest of your day!\\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome, glad I could assist. Enjoy your trip to San Francisco! You have a good day as well.\\n\\nCustomer: Thanks, you too! Goodbye.\\n\\nAgent: Goodbye!\\n\\n*call disconnects*\",\n          \"\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines, my name is Sarah, how may I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi Sarah, umm I'm calling about a flight I had booked from Chicago to Boston last week. It got delayed by a couple hours and I missed my connecting flight.\\n\\nAgent: I'm sorry to hear about that delay, what are the dates of your travels so I can take a look at your reservation? \\n\\nCustomer: It was last Thursday, May 12th. Flight number was UA1402, it was supposed to leave Chicago at 2pm but ended up leaving around 4pm.\\n\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull up your reservation. *typing sounds* Yep, I see here your flight from Chicago to Boston was delayed due to bad weather in Chicago that day. The flight ended up departing at 4:17pm instead of the scheduled 2pm time. I understand that must have caused you to miss your connecting flight to your final destination. One moment while I take a look at our policies in this situation. *longer pause as agent reviews policies* So based on the delay being due to weather, which is considered a controllable delay by United, you would be eligible for a one-time goodwill gesture from us due to the missed connection. I can offer to refund your ticket for that flight, or apply the amount as a travel credit to use for a future booking. Which option would you prefer?\\n\\nCustomer: Hmm that's really nice of you guys to offer one of those options as a goodwill gesture. I think I'll go with the travel credit if that's ok, I'm sure to fly United again at some point in the next year. It'll be nice to have that credit available. \\n\\nAgent: Absolutely, I've gone ahead and processed a full travel credit for the value of your May 12th ticket. The credit will be valid for one year from today and can be used for future United flights. The reference number for that is CR348921. Please keep that on hand in case you need it when booking your next trip. I'm glad we could resolve this situation to your satisfaction. Thank you for understanding about the weather delay causing your missed connection. Is there anything else I can help with today?\\n\\nCustomer: No, I think that covers it. Thanks so much for your help, Sarah. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this and provide that travel credit. It will definitely be used.\\n\\nAgent: You're very welcome, have a great rest of your day!\\n\\nCustomer: You too, thanks again and bye!\\n\\nAgent: Goodbye!\",\n          \"\\n\\nAgent: Thank you for calling United Airlines, this is Steve how can I help you today?\\n\\nCustomer: Hi Steve, yeah I'm calling because I have a flight booked from Chicago to New York next week and I was hoping to change it. *sigh* This work thing has come up last minute and I need to fly out a day earlier.\\n\\nAgent: I understand, last minute changes can be frustrating. Let me take a look at your booking and see what I can do for you. What's the name the reservation is under?\\n\\nCustomer: It's under John Smith. The original flight was supposed to leave next Thursday.\\n\\nAgent: Okay, let me pull that up... *typing sounds* Alright, I've got your reservation here Mr. Smith. It looks like the flight you booked is pretty full for the day before. Let me check some alternate flight options... *more typing* Hmm, the only option I see is a late afternoon flight that leaves at 4pm, would that work for your schedule?\\n\\nCustomer: Ugh yeah I think that could work, but is it going to cost me a lot more to change it last minute like this? Money is a bit tight with everything going on.\\n\\nAgent: I understand the financial concerns. Unfortunately because it is within 7 days of travel, there would be a change fee applied. The good news is because this flight is still fairly full, the fare difference is only an additional $100 on top of the standard $200 change fee. So your new total would be $300 to switch to that earlier flight. Does that work for your budget?\\n\\nCustomer: *sighs* Yeah I guess $300 is better than having to reschedule the whole work thing. Alright, go ahead and change it for me then.\\n\\nAgent: No problem, I'm happy I could find an option that works. Let me go ahead and process that change for you... *typing sounds* Okay, all set! You're now booked on the 4pm flight next Wednesday. You'll receive an email confirmation shortly. Do you need anything else from me today?\\n\\nCustomer: No, I think that covers it.
